# CompoundInterestCalculator
A simple JavaFX compounding interest calculator

This is a simple compounding interest calculator intended to test the basic features of JavaFx. 
The end goal of the project is to add a second stage that shows the expected payout from retirement
until death of either a lump sum retirement account versus the payout of a comparable annuity. 
Ideally the calculator will have the option to store calculated data into a SQL server database.
